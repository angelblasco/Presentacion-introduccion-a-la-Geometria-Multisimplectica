The problem is formulated on the tangent bundle for Lagrangian systems in order to avoid the bias of the existence of a natural symplectic structure on the cotangent bundle. First it is developed for systems described by regular Lagrangians and then extended to systems described by singular Lagrangians with no secondary constraints. We also consider the example of the free relativistic particle, the rigid body and the electron-monopole system.},

The Hamilton-Jacobi problem is stated for the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formalisms of these theories as a particular case of a more general problem, and the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation for ﬁeld theories is recovered from this geometrical setting. Particular and complete solutions to these problems are deﬁned and characterized in several equivalent ways in both formalisms, and the equivalence between them is proved. The use of distributions in jet bundles that represent the solutions to the ﬁeld equations is the fundamental tool in this formulation. Some examples are analyzed and, in particular, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for non-autonomous mechanical systems is obtained as a special case of our results.},

Nambu mechanics aims to generalize classical Hamiltonian mechanics to ideal dynamical systems bearing two Hamiltonians, but its connection to a suitable geometric framework has remained elusive. This work establishes a novel correspondence between generalized Hamiltonian mechanics, defined for systems with a phase space conservation law (invariance of a closed form) and a matter conservation law (invariance of multiple Hamiltonians), and classical Hamiltonian mechanics via multisymplectic geometry. The key lies in the invertibility of differential forms of degree higher than 2. We demonstrate that the cornerstone theorems of classical Hamiltonian mechanics (Lie-Darboux and Liouville) require reinterpretation within this new framework, reflecting the unique properties of invertibility in multisymplectic geometry. Furthermore, we present two key theorems that solidify the connection: i) any classical Hamiltonian system with two or more invariants is also a generalized Hamiltonian system and ii) given a generalized Hamiltonian system with two or more invariants, there exists a corresponding classical Hamiltonian system on the level set of all but one invariant, with the remaining invariant playing the role of the Hamiltonian function.},

This thesis develops the theory of {\textbackslash}emph\{relative \$n\$-plectic structures\}, where the classical condition is replaced by a closed, nondegenerate {\textbackslash}emph\{relative\} \$(n+1)\$-form defined with respect to a smooth map. Analogous to how \$n\$-plectic manifolds give rise to \$L\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-algebras of observables, we show that relative \$n\$-plectic structures naturally induce corresponding \$L\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-algebras. These structures provide a conceptual bridge between the frameworks of quasi-Hamiltonian \$G\$-spaces and \$2\$-plectic geometry. As an application, we examine the relative \$2\$-plectic structure canonically associated to quasi-Hamiltonian \$G\$-spaces. We show that every quasi-Hamiltonian \$G\$-space defines a closed, nondegenerate relative \$3\$-form, and that the group action induces a Hamiltonian infinitesimal action compatible with this structure. We then construct explicit homotopy moment maps as \$L\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-morphisms from the Lie algebra \${\textbackslash}mathfrak\{g\}\$ into the Lie \$2\$-algebra of relative observables, extending the moment map formalism to the higher and relative geometric setting.},
